# CodeAlpha_EDA
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python.
The main objective was to understand the dataset, clean it if needed, and find useful insights through analysis.

Steps 

1. Imported Libraries

pandas for data handling and analysis.


2. Loaded the Dataset

Read the quotes.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.


3. Checked the Dataset

Viewed the first few rows using head().

Used info() to check datatypes and structure.

Checked summary statistics with describe().


4. Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values (none were found).

Verified dataset size and structure.


5. Data Analysis

Counted number of quotes per author.

Calculated average length of quotes.


6. Visualization (optional for extension)

Simple counts and averages were analyzed.

Could be extended with bar graphs or plots for better insights.


Output :-

Dataset is clean with 0 missing values.

Albert Einstein has the most quotes.

Average quote length is around 89 characters.



Tools Used :-

Python

Pandas (for analysis)
